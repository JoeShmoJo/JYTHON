"""
Extract selected ResSim results from a simulation.dss into CSV files, one CSV
per group (reservoirs, limits, junctions, diversions, rules).

Runs on a DESKTOP Python 3 with pydsstools and pandas (the hydro39 conda
environment), not inside ResSim. Paste the path to simulation.dss into DSS_PATH
below, then:
    conda activate hydro39
    python model_check/extract_dss.py

A path given on the command line overrides DSS_PATH.

Output goes to model_check/output/<simulation>_<alternative>_<date>/, e.g.
output/Script_Cleanup_Test_Temp1Day_2026-09-25/. For each group it writes:
    <group>.csv          Date, then one column per series, named "<B> <C>"
    <group>_series.csv   one row per column: its full pathname and units
and run_info.json, which check_model.py reads to find the alternative's configs.

Records are chosen by the rules in SELECTIONS, matched against every pathname
in the file, so a new reservoir or junction is picked up without editing this
script. Run catalog_dss.py to see what a file holds.
