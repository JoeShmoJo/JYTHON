"""
Extract selected ResSim results from a simulation.dss into CSV files, one CSV
per group (reservoirs, limits, junctions, diversions).

Runs on a DESKTOP Python 3 with pydsstools and pandas (the hydro39 conda
environment), not inside ResSim. Paste the path to simulation.dss into DSS_PATH
below, then:
    conda activate hydro39
    python data/scripts/_migration/extract_dss.py

A path given on the command line overrides DSS_PATH.

For each group it writes, next to the DSS file:
    <group>.csv          Date, then one column per series, named "<B> <C>"
    <group>_series.csv   one row per column: its full pathname and units

Records are chosen by the rules in SELECTIONS, matched against every pathname
in the file, so a new reservoir or junction is picked up without editing this
script. Run catalog_dss.py to see what a file holds.
