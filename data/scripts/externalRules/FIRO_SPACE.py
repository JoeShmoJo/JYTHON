FIRO_SPACE
Scripted rule that steers the pool toward a FIRO space rule curve that is read
from an external CSV instead of being defined as a zone in ResSim.

How it works
------------
initRuleScript (once per compute):
    Reads a generic-year (no year, just Month/Day) daily elevation CSV and builds
    a piecewise-linear curve of day-of-year -> FIRO_SPACE elevation for this
    reservoir. Also grabs the reservoir's elevation-storage table.

runRuleScript (every timestep):
    Looks up the FIRO_SPACE elevation for today, converts it to storage, and
    computes the release that would land the pool exactly on that storage at the
    end of the current timestep:

        qTarget = inflow + (storPrev - targetStor) / cfsToAcFt

    Then it sets ONE limit, depending on which side of the curve the pool is on:

        default ("DRAFT_ONLY") -> RULETYPE_MIN = qTarget, always.
            Above the curve this forces a draft. Below the curve qTarget falls
            below inflow, so the limit goes slack on its own and only binds if
            something else would release so little that the pool overshoots the
            curve. The result is "hold the pool at or below FIRO_SPACE".

        "BOTH" -> adds a RULETYPE_MAX = qTarget when the pool is below the
            curve, which actively forces a refill. See the warning below.

    The limit is a CONTINUOUS function of the storage error: as the pool
    approaches the curve, qTarget approaches inflow. There is deliberately no
    "rule does not bind" branch. An earlier version returned MIN = 0 when the
    pool was near the curve, which handed control back to the rest of the stack
    the instant the target was met and produced a hard one-day-period
    oscillation -- the pool floated up off the curve, got slammed back down, and
    repeated. Do not reintroduce a discontinuity here.

    This rule only proposes the target. Other rules in the stack are expected to
    constrain the release further (outlet capacity, min flows, ramp rates, etc.).

NOTE ON THE FILL HALF
    The fill branch issues a MAXIMUM release, which by design competes with
    minimum-flow rules. Stack placement matters. If the fill behavior causes
    trouble at a project, set that project to "DRAFT_ONLY" in MODE_BY_RESERVOIR
    below rather than deleting the rule.

Config CSV format (wide, one row per day of a generic year):
    Month,Day,Detroit,Hills Creek,Lookout Point,...
    1,1,1450.0,1448.0,825.0,...
    1,2,1450.0,,825.1,...

    A day has a target only where that day's cell holds a number. A BLANK cell
    means NO TARGET on that day: the rule returns a limit that does not bind and
    the rest of the stack operates the project. So you can leave whole stretches
    of the year uncontrolled just by clearing those cells.

    Column headers are matched to ResSim reservoir names ignoring surrounding
    whitespace and letter case, so a stray space after a name in the header does
    not silently hide the column.

    A reservoir with no numbers at all -- a column of blanks, or no column --
    is simply never controlled. That is not an error, so one config file can
    serve a whole watershed while only some projects use the rule. Set
    REQUIRE_RESERVOIR_IN_CONFIG to True to make it an error instead.

    Lines starting with # are comments. A "Notes" column is ignored.

    Targets are held in a 365-entry per-day lookup table rather than an
    Interpolate object, because "this day has no target" is not something a
    continuous interpolation can express.
