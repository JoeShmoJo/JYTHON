"""
Damages Prevented settings: where every input and output lives, and which
reservoirs are paired with a re-regulating dam.

Every path is relative to the watershed folder. The menu shows them, and each
step writes one line to its log saying which files it used.

Everything Damages Prevented uses lives under scripts/DamagesPrevented:
    DP_Download/out/obsData.dss   downloaded USGS/CWMS data (DP_Download/DP_Download.py, desktop Python)
    DPdata/DPcalc.dss             computed locals the alternatives read
                                  (Willamette Falls + water-balance locals)
    DPdata/MiniSimulations.dss    mini-simulation time series
    DPdata/Results/*.csv          flow reduction tables
    DPdata/logs/*.log             one log per step
