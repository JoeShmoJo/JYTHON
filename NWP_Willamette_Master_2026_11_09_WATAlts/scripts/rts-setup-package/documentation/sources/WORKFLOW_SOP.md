# Operator SOP: standalone ResSim and RTS

Start with [project handoff](PROJECT_START_HERE.md). For exact files and producers,
use the [standalone/shared reference](STANDALONE_WORKFLOW_REFERENCE.md) and
[RTS reference](RTS_WORKFLOW_REFERENCE.md). All compute is manual in ResSim/RTS.

## Common rules

- Saving a configuration stores settings. Applying activates settings for the
  target's next initialization. Computing produces results. RTS acceptance archives
  completed results. These are four separate actions.
- Finish computes and close DSS views before file-writing jobs. Restart once after
  script installation/mode changes. Verify every target banner before Apply.
- Keep one native model alternative and change named settings within it. The editor
  does not change native operation sets, rule bindings, input mappings or dates.
- Preserve outputs needed for comparison before recomputing. Do not accept a failed
  or partial run. Check current native logs and all intended members/window.

## A. Standalone ResSim

1. Open the watershed and desired simulation in the Simulation module. Note the
   simulation directory and alternative shown in Simulation Control. Select
   **Simulation type: Ensemble or Single POR** in the workflow menu.
2. Open the Script Editor in that module and run this single line:

```python
from hec.script import ClientAppWrapper; import os; execfile(os.path.join(str(ClientAppWrapper.getWatershed().getWkspDir()), 'scripts', 'STANDALONE_WORKFLOW_MENU.py'))
```

3. Select the intended simulation and alternative, then open **Baseline
   Configuration**. In Configuration Overview, review **Standalone job settings**:
   OSI source member (plot-trial controls are retired).
   Save/Apply these settings before ensemble extraction/calculation jobs.
   No separate CONFIG.py editing is required. Individual downloader/date/member
   constants and native mappings must still fit the intended study.
4. If inputs are needed, run **Extract ensemble inputs**. Wait for successful
   completion and inspect the job log and actual simulation.dss input coverage.
   Do not extract again merely to change baseline operating settings.
5. **For baseline settings:** Select the explicit simulation folder and enter the
   native alternative name. Open **Baseline Configuration**; verify the browser's
   target matches Simulation Control. Import legacy settings or open a saved set.
6. Edit/name **Save Configuration**, then **Apply to Standalone Alternative**.
   Save alone does not activate settings. Verify your model's baseline trial has
   augmentation disabled through its existing conventions; Apply does not do this.
7. Compute the baseline trial manually. Verify current log completion, ensemble
   coverage and initialization receipts. Use **Archive / Plot Results** to save a
   named **New baseline** before calculating augmentation or overwriting outputs.
8. Configure the existing standalone augmentation reservoir/target CSVs and trials.
   **Calculate augmentation** reads the selected target’s baseline outputs and writes
   release requirements into that simulation DSS. Verify the log and paths.
9. Compute the augmented case, verify completion, and archive it as a named
   result paired with the baseline saved in step 7. Select one or two archived
   runs for plotting. Plotting does not require a new Apply or the live DSS file.
10. For another baseline, edit/save/apply settings and repeat compute/archive;
    retain old baselines and result pairings. See [saved-run instructions](STANDALONE_SAVED_RESULTS.md)
    for ordering, exact capture selection and input/output locations.

Existing default legacy settings use AutoDetect with omitted augmentation trials
`0,2,3`; do not assume a locally edited alternative retains those defaults.
Native rules/trial bindings must agree with the intended comparison.

For single POR plotting and checking one POR run or one ensemble member, follow
[POR and Model Check instructions](STANDALONE_POR_MODEL_CHECK.md). OSI is not
required in Single POR mode; existing POR inputs/native compute are used.

## B. RTS / CWMS

First import the complete watershed and activate RTS script mode in that copy,
using [package/import instructions](WORKFLOW_PACKAGE.md). Then:

1. Select the intended forecast/run. Run `scripts/RTS_WORKFLOW_MENU.py` in the RTS
   Script Editor. Verify forecast, run, DSS path, lookback, start/end and timezone.
   Refresh metadata if selection changed.
2. **Initial Extract** once. Wait for successful promotion and refresh/reopen the
   forecast as instructed. It loads inputs; it does not run ResSim.
3. **Baseline Configuration** → open/import/edit → **Save Configuration** →
   **Apply for Baseline Compute**. Apply disables RTS augmentation. Finish computes
   and release the forecast as instructed for file changes. Reopen/refresh afterward.
4. Confirm next compute has no augmentation; compute manually. Verify successful
   member completion and required coverage in current logs/results.
5. Open **Augmentation Configuration**. Answer **Yes** to accept the just-completed
   baseline. Yes is your confirmation of successful compute; No uses saved results;
   Cancel stops. Check the accepted baseline ID.
6. Name/configure/save the augmentation settings. Select an available season and
   **Process and Load Releases**. Answer Yes to an acceptance prompt only for new
   completed output; otherwise No. Wait for successful loading and check activation.
7. Reopen/refresh as instructed; compute manually with loaded augmentation. Do not
   run Initial Extract again. Confirm completion for all requested members.
8. **Plot Results** → Yes to accept the completed augmented run → select the baseline
   and its augmented result → plot. Check pairing labels and plot read reports.
9. For a new baseline: load/edit/save/apply baseline settings, compute unaugmented,
   accept, create/process/load a new scheme, compute augmented, accept and compare.
   Old result pairings remain attached to their original baselines.

Use the [full RTS SOP](RTS_OPERATOR_SOP.md) for coverage requirements, result
selection/deletion and detailed checks. Fixed-abundant water-year data must be
ALL_ABUNDANT **4**, not the zero dummy. A short October test may not support an
April–October augmentation calculation.

## Stop and diagnose

| Situation | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Wrong target | Close editor; choose correct simulation/alternative or forecast; reopen and Apply there |
| Missing input dates/members | Fix extraction or mapping before computing; do not infer coverage from catalog presence |
| Compute fails/hangs | Preserve log; inspect worker logs/current process; do not archive as successful |
| No initialized receipt | Check installed adapter/mode, exact output DSS and alternative; restart and retest |
| Archive/loader fails | Read printed job log; preserve candidate and recovery backup; do not repeatedly overwrite live data |
| No augmentation season | Use a baseline with necessary seasonal coverage |
| Reopening after a long break | Follow PROJECT_START_HERE.md and inventory before launching a large compute |
