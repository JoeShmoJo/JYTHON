Find the dollar reduction associated with each project:
    1 - Calculate the damages prevented for each event by interpolating from the 2024 Disposition damage curves from the Damages Prevented Flow Reductions CP_Peaks calculated by the ResSim Scripts
    2 - Correct the Preliminary_per_project flow rductions calcuated by the ResSim Scripts:

        2a - Sum the individual project reductions and find the difference between the sum and the total difference
        2b - Sum the reductions (positive or negative) for reservoir groups ([Hills Creek, Lookout Point, Fall Creek],[Green Peter, Foster],[Cottage Grove,Dorena]) and distributing the sum for
            group by the percent flood storage the group has. This script has the functionality to easilly add or modify groups
        2v - Distribute the difference beween the sum of the reductions and the total by the percent flood storage of a contributing reservoir to the total flood storage of each contributing
            reservoir.

    4 - Find the proportional reduction for the event provided by each reservoir.
    5 - Multiply the proportional flow reduction for each location by the $$$ Damages Prevented
